The final target at the weekly high offers an opportunity to capture the full upside potential.\n\nPosition Sizing and Risk Management:\n- Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading account per position.\n- Calculate the appropriate position size based on the stop loss level and the risk tolerance.\n- Consider using a trailing stop-loss order to protect profits as the trade progresses.\n\nKey Levels to Watch:\n- 5370.875 (50% Fibonacci level) - Potential entry point\n- 5311.49 (38.2% Fibonacci level) - Alternative entry point\n- 5119.26 (0% Fibonacci level) - Stop loss level\n- 5514.80 (78.6% Fibonacci extension) - First take-profit target\n- 5622.49 (100% Fibonacci extension) - Second take-profit target\n- 5669.67 (weekly high) - Third take-profit target\n\nPotential Catalysts:\n- Continued strength in the broader US equity markets, driven by positive economic data or positive sentiment\n- Lack of any significant geopolitical or macroeconomic events that could disrupt the current bullish momentum\n\nTimeframe Alignment Summary\n\nThe analysis across the 90-minute, daily, and weekly timeframes shows a high degree of alignment in favor of a bullish outlook for the S&P 500 index. The trend is firmly established, with higher highs and higher lows visible on all three timeframes. The technical indicators, such as the WaveTrend oscillator, Awesome Oscillator, and RSI, predominantly confirm the bullish bias, with the weekly chart providing the strongest signals.\n\nThe only potential point of concern is the recent bearish crossover in the Awesome Oscillator on the daily chart, which could signal a temporary shift in momentum. However, the overall market structure and the alignment of the other technical indicators across the timeframes suggest that this may be a temporary pullback within the broader uptrend.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of the S&P 500 index across the 90-minute, daily, and weekly timeframes suggests a high-quality setup for a long trade. The bullish trend is well-established, with strong technical indicators and favorable price action confirming the bullish bias.
