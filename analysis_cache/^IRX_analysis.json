Price Action Analysis</h2>\n<h3>a) Candlestick Patterns</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart shows a series of indecisive candlestick patterns, including small-bodied candles and doji formations. This suggests the market is currently in a consolidation phase, lacking clear directional bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nOn the daily timeframe, we can observe a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, which indicates potential selling pressure and a possible reversal of the recent uptrend.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart displays a bearish harami pattern, further confirming the potential for a bearish reversal in the longer-term trend.</p>\n<h3>b) Chart Patterns</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart does not clearly display any significant chart patterns, as the market is in a consolidation phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nOn the daily timeframe, the price action has formed a bearish flag pattern, suggesting a continuation of the recent downtrend.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart shows the formation of a potential descending triangle pattern, with a clear downward-sloping resistance line and a horizontal support level. This pattern often signals a bearish breakout.</p>\n<h3>c) Market Structure</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart exhibits a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish market structure. However, the market is currently range-bound, with no clear directional bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nThe daily chart has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming the overall bearish market structure. The most recent price action has broken below the previous swing low, further strengthening the bearish bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart displays a clear downtrend, with a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The market structure is firmly bearish, suggesting a potential continuation of the downward trend.</p>\n<h3>d) Support and Resistance</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart shows the price action approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move, which could act as a support level. However, the market is currently range-bound, and this level may not hold significant significance.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nOn the daily timeframe, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.128999948501587 appears to be acting as a resistance level, capping the recent upward movements. The price has also broken below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.180683972358704, which could now act as a dynamic resistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart shows the price has broken below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 2.0429360189437866, which may now serve as a resistance level. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.2621280117034912 could provide support, but the overall bearish structure suggests this level may not hold.</p>\n<h3>e) Price Action Momentum</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart exhibits a lack of strong momentum, with the price action confined within a tight range. The indecisive candlestick patterns and small price swings suggest a consolidation phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nThe daily chart displays a strong bearish momentum, as evidenced by the bearish engulfing candle and the subsequent breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. This signals potential for further downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart demonstrates a persistent bearish momentum, with each candle forming lower highs and lower lows. The bearish harami pattern and the potential formation of a descending triangle pattern further confirm the bearish bias.</p>\n<h3>f) Orderblocks and Liquidity</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart does not clearly identify any significant orderblocks or liquidity areas due to the range-bound nature of the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has broken below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.180683972358704, which could have acted as a liquidity pool. The breakdown below this level may have triggered further selling pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart shows a significant orderblock area around the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 2.6740000247955322. This level may act as a strong support or resistance, depending on the direction of the breakout.</p>\n<h3>g) Fibonacci Levels</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong>\nThe 90-minute chart displays the price approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.020015888214111, which could provide some support.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong>\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has broken below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.180683972358704, which may now act as a resistance. The 50% Fibonacci level at 5.128999948501587 could also provide resistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong>\nThe weekly chart shows the price has broken below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 2.0429360189437866, which may now serve as a resistance. The 23.6% Fibonacci level at 1.2621280117034912 could provide some support, but the overall bearish structure suggests this level may not hold.</p>\n<h2>2. Trend Analysis</h2>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The 90-minute chart is currently in a consolidation phase, lacking a clear directional trend.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The daily chart displays a bearish trend, with a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The recent breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level suggests the bearish trend may continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> The weekly chart exhibits a clear downtrend, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. The potential formation of a descending triangle pattern further confirms the bearish bias in the longer-term timeframe.</p>\n<h2>3. Indicator Analysis</h2>\n<h3>a) WaveTrend (WT_LB)</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The WaveTrend indicator on the 90-minute chart is currently in a neutral zone, with the WT1 and WT2 lines hovering around the zero line. This suggests a lack of clear directional momentum.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The WaveTrend indicator on the daily chart is firmly in the bearish territory, with both the WT1 and WT2 lines below the zero line. This confirms the overall bearish bias on the daily timeframe.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> On the weekly chart, the WaveTrend indicator is also deeply in the bearish zone, with the WT1 line at -85.4740515225907 and the WT2 line at -59.81356867125678. This reinforces the longer-term bearish trend.</p>\n<h3>b) Awesome Oscillator (AO)</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The Awesome Oscillator on the 90-minute chart is hovering just above the zero line, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The Awesome Oscillator on the daily chart has crossed below the zero line, suggesting the presence of bearish momentum.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> On the weekly timeframe, the Awesome Oscillator is also below the zero line, further confirming the bearish bias in the longer-term trend.</p>\n<h3>c) RSI</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The RSI on the 90-minute chart is at 53.273351432315934, indicating a neutral market condition without a clear directional bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The RSI on the daily chart is at 35.35163176385623, which is in the bearish oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term bounce or reversal.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> On the weekly timeframe, the RSI is at 28.945595087523344, well into the oversold zone. This implies a strong bearish momentum in the longer-term trend.</p>\n<h3>d) MA-X</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The 90-minute chart shows the fast moving average at 5.074960520169839 and the slow moving average at 5.073145609694635. The close proximity of these moving averages suggests a lack of clear trend direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> On the daily timeframe, the fast moving average at 5.072740317890907 has crossed below the slow moving average at 5.086797831506184, indicating a bearish crossover and confirming the downward trend.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> The weekly chart displays the fast moving average at 5.102606131782486 and the slow moving average at 5.15601583503547. The downward slope of these moving averages aligns with the overall bearish trend on the weekly timeframe.</p>\n<h3>e) Bollinger Bands</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The 90-minute chart shows the Bollinger Bands in a relatively tight formation, with the price confined within the bands. This suggests a period of low volatility and consolidation.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> On the daily timeframe, the price has broken below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating increased bearish momentum and potential for further downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> The weekly chart does not provide any Bollinger Bands data, as the indicator cannot be calculated due to the lack of sufficient historical data.</p>\n<h3>f) On-Balance Volume (OBV)</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator on the 90-minute chart is flat, indicating a lack of significant volume-based buying or selling pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The OBV on the daily chart is also flat, aligning with the overall lack of volume-based directional bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> The weekly chart does not provide any OBV data, as the indicator cannot be calculated due to the lack of sufficient historical data.</p>\n<h3>g) Average True Range (ATR)</h3>\n<p><strong>90-minute Chart:</strong> The Average True Range (ATR) on the 90-minute chart is 0.009292944687922664, suggesting a relatively low level of volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily Chart:</strong> The ATR on the daily chart is 0.029793605101134345, which is higher than the 90-minute timeframe, indicating increased volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly Chart:</strong> The ATR on the weekly chart is 0.41562103730968836, significantly higher than the shorter timeframes. This implies a higher level of overall market volatility in the longer-term trend.</p>\n<h2>4. Multi-Timeframe Confluence</h2>\n<p>Analyzing the price action, technical indicators, and Fibonacci levels across the 90-minute, daily, and weekly timeframes reveals the following confluences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bearish Bias:</strong> The daily and weekly charts display a clear bearish bias, with lower highs and lower lows, bearish candlestick patterns, and bearish technical indicator signals. The potential formation of a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart and a descending triangle pattern on the weekly chart further confirm the bearish outlook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fibonacci Levels:</strong> The breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart and the 38.2% level on the weekly chart suggests these levels may now act as resistance. The potential support at the 23.6% Fibonacci level on the weekly chart may not hold due to the overall bearish structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Indicator Alignment:</strong> The WaveTrend, Awesome Oscillator, and moving averages on the daily and weekly charts are all confirming the bearish bias, with the indicators firmly in the bearish territory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Volatility Increase:</strong> The increase in the Average True Range from the 90-minute to the daily and weekly timeframes indicates a rise in market volatility, which could amplify the directional moves.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, the multi-timeframe analysis strongly suggests a bearish bias for the ^IRX instrument, with the potential for further downside in the coming period.</p>\n<h2>5. Setup Quality Assessment: 8/10</h2>\n<p>The setup for ^IRX appears to be of high quality, with a strong bearish bias supported by the alignment of price action, technical indicators, and Fibonacci levels across the 90-minute, daily, and weekly timeframes. The presence of clear bearish patterns, such as the bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart and the potential descending triangle on the weekly chart, further strengthens the case for a bearish trade opportunity.</p>\n<h2>6. Directional Bias: SHORT</h2>\n<h3>Rationale for Short Bias</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bearish Price Action:</strong> The price action across all timeframes, particularly the breakdown below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart and the potential formation of a descending triangle pattern on the weekly chart, suggests a bearish bias.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bearish Indicator Signals:</strong> The WaveTrend, Awesome Oscillator, and moving averages on the daily and weekly charts are firmly in the bearish territory, confirming the downward momentum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bearish Market Structure:</strong> The sequence of lower highs and lower lows on the daily and weekly charts, along with the breakdown of support levels, indicates a well-established bearish market structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increase in Volatility:</strong> The rise in the Average True Range across the timeframes suggests that the market may experience increased volatility, which could amplify the downward movements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis of price action, technical indicators, and multi-timeframe confluence, the weight of the evidence points to a high-probability short trade setup for the ^IRX instrument.</p>\n<h2>7.
