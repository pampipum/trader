the daily chart.\n- The 50-period simple moving average (MA-X Slow) is acting as dynamic resistance, further confirming the bearish structure.\n- Momentum indicators, such as the RSI and Awesome Oscillator, are also aligned with the downtrend, suggesting continued selling pressure.\n- The WaveTrend oscillator is in a bearish state, with both the WT1 and WT2 lines below the oversold level of -60.\n\n**Weekly Timeframe (1W):**\n- The weekly timeframe displays a similar bearish structure, with the price forming a series of lower highs and lower lows.\n- The 50-period simple moving average (MA-X Slow) on the weekly chart is also acting as dynamic resistance, further reinforcing the overall downtrend.\n- The WaveTrend oscillator on the weekly chart is also in a bearish state, with both the WT1 and WT2 lines below the oversold level.\n- The Awesome Oscillator on the weekly timeframe is negative, indicating bearish momentum.\n\nThe alignment of the daily and weekly timeframes suggests a strong, consistent downtrend in the 10-Year Treasury Yield, with the lower timeframe reinforcing the overall bearish structure.\n\n### Detailed Price Action Analysis\n\n**Candlestick Patterns:**\n- On the daily chart, there are several bearish candlestick patterns, such as long upper wicks and spinning top formations, indicating selling pressure and potential resistance levels.\n- The weekly chart also shows a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, further confirming the bearish sentiment.\n\n**Chart Patterns:**\n- The daily chart displays a potential bearish flag or pennant formation, which, if confirmed, could lead to an extended downward move.\n- On the weekly timeframe, the price action appears to be forming a bearish descending triangle pattern, a classic continuation pattern that could signal further downside.\n\n**Support and Resistance:**\n- On the daily chart, the Fibonacci levels at 38.2% (4.176) and 50% (4.333) appear to be acting as resistance, with the price repeatedly failing to breach these levels.\n- On the weekly timeframe, the Fibonacci levels at 23.6% (1.179) and 38.2% (1.909) could provide potential support areas if the downtrend continues.\n\n**Momentum and Orderblocks:**\n- The negative readings on the Awesome Oscillator and the bearish state of the WaveTrend oscillator across both timeframes suggest strong downward momentum.\n- Significant orderblock areas can be identified around the Fibonacci levels mentioned above, as these areas have shown the potential to act as strong support or resistance.\n\n### Indicator Analysis\n\n**WaveTrend Oscillator (WT):**\n- On the daily chart, the WT1 and WT2 lines are both below the oversold level of -60, indicating a strong bearish bias.\n- The weekly chart also shows the WT1 and WT2 lines in a bearish state, further confirming the downward trend.\n\n**Awesome Oscillator (AO):**\n- The AO is negative on both the daily and weekly timeframes, indicating bearish momentum.\n- The AO has formed a series of lower highs, aligning with the overall downtrend.\n\n**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**\n- The RSI on the daily chart is currently at 37.11, suggesting the market is not yet oversold.\n- The weekly RSI is at 36.68, also indicating a bearish bias.\n\n**Moving Averages (MA-X):**\n- On the daily chart, the 50-period simple moving average (MA-X Slow) is acting as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the bearish structure.\n- The weekly MA-X Slow is also sloping downward, confirming the bearish trend.\n\n**Bollinger Bands:**\n- On the daily chart, the price is currently trading below the middle Bollinger Band, indicating a potential bearish continuation.\n- However, the Bollinger Bands on the weekly timeframe are not available due to insufficient data.\n\n**On-Balance Volume (OBV):**\n- The OBV on both the daily and weekly timeframes is flat, indicating a lack of significant volume participation in the recent price movements.\n\n**Average True Range (ATR):**\n- The ATR on the daily chart is 0.078, suggesting relatively low volatility at the moment.\n- The weekly ATR is 0.444, indicating higher volatility on the longer timeframe.\n\n### Historical Context and Inter-Market Analysis\n\n- The 10-Year Treasury Yield has been in a broader uptrend over the past year, reflecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation.\n- However, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential shift towards a bearish bias, potentially driven by changing market expectations or broader macroeconomic factors.\n- It is essential to consider the relationship between the 10-Year Treasury Yield and other financial markets, such as equities and commodities, as these inter-market correlations can provide valuable insights into the overall market dynamics.\n\n### Quantitative Measures\n\n**Potential Entry Levels:**\n- Based on the Fibonacci levels and the current market structure, potential entry levels for a short trade could be around the 38.2% Fibonacci level at 4.176 or the 50% level at 4.333.\n\n**Stop Loss Levels:**\n- The stop loss could be placed above the recent swing high at 4.495 (61.8% Fibonacci level) or the 52-week high at 4.997.\n\n**Take Profit Targets:**\n- The initial take profit target could be the 23.6% Fibonacci level at 3.982, with a potential second target at the 38.2% level of 4.176.\n- A more aggressive target could be the 0% Fibonacci level at 3.669, which represents the low of the current range.\n\n**Risk-Reward Ratio:**\n- Assuming an entry at 4.176 (38.2% Fibonacci level) and a stop loss at 4.495 (61.8% Fibonacci level), the initial risk-reward ratio would be approximately 1:1.5.\n- If the price reaches the 23.6% Fibonacci level at 3.982 as the first take profit target, the risk-reward ratio would improve to approximately 1:2.\n\n### Setup Quality Assessment\n\nApplying the comprehensive framework to assess the setup quality across the daily and weekly timeframes:\n\na) Trend Strength and Consistency (20/25 points):\n   - The daily and weekly charts both display a clear downtrend, with the MA-X indicator confirming the trend direction.\n

RSI is in bearish territory on both timeframes, aligning with the downtrend.\n   - The Bollinger Bands on the daily chart suggest potential continuation of the downward move, but the weekly Bollinger Bands are not available.\n\nc) WaveTrend Oscillator Analysis (15/15 points):\n   - The WaveTrend oscillator is in a bearish state on both the daily and weekly charts, with both the WT1 and WT2 lines below the oversold level.\n\nd) Awesome Oscillator Confirmation (10/15 points):\n   - The Awesome Oscillator is negative on both timeframes, confirming the bearish momentum.\n   - However, the weekly AO is in a slightly less bearish state compared to the daily timeframe.\n\ne) Volume Analysis (10/10 points):\n   - The On-Balance Volume is flat on both timeframes, indicating a lack of significant volume participation.\n   - The average trading volume is also low, suggesting relatively low liquidity.\n\nf) Risk-Reward Ratio (10/10 points):\n   - The potential risk-reward ratio based on the current market structure is approximately 1:2, which is favorable.\n\ng) Fibonacci Alignment (5/5 points):\n   - The current price is near the 38.2% Fibonacci level, which aligns with the potential bearish trade setup.\n\n**Total Score: 85/100 (8.5/10)**\n\nThe overall setup quality scores an 8.5 out of 10, indicating a strong bearish setup across the daily and weekly timeframes.
