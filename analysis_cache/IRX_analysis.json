The technical indicators, including RSI, Wave Trend, and Awesome Oscillator, are all aligned with the downtrend.\n\nUsing the provided framework for setup quality assessment, the current setup can be evaluated as follows:\n\na) Trend Strength and Consistency (25/25 points): The trend is bearish and consistent across both the daily and weekly timeframes.\nb) Momentum and Volatility (15/20 points): The RSI is in oversold territory, but the Bollinger Bands are not providing a clear signal.\nc) WaveTrend Oscillator Analysis (15/15 points): The WT1 and WT2 lines are both below the -60 level, confirming the bearish trend.\nd) Awesome Oscillator Confirmation (15/15 points): The AO is negative, aligning with the overall bearish trend.\ne) Volume Analysis (5/10 points): The OBV is flat, indicating a lack of significant buying or selling pressure.\nf) Risk-Reward Ratio (5/10 points): The potential risk-reward ratio is not optimal, as the Bollinger Bands and recent swing levels do not provide clear targets.\ng) Fibonacci Alignment (5/5 points): The current price is near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which could act as resistance.\n\nTotal Score: 85/100 points, which corresponds to a \"Strong Setup\" on the 1-10 scale.\n\n## Directional Bias and Detailed Trade Idea\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the high-quality setup (score of 8) indicates a potential SHORT trade opportunity in ^IRX.\n\nThe rationale for the bearish bias is as follows:\n- The consistent downtrend across both the daily and weekly timeframes, with lower highs and lower lows\n- The oversold readings on the RSI and Wave Trend oscillator, suggesting the potential for a short-term bounce or reversal\n- The alignment of the technical indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator and Moving Averages, confirming the bearish market structure\n\nEntry: Short entry could be considered near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 5.077, with a potential target of the 50% Fibonacci level at 5.129.\n\nStop Loss: The stop loss could be placed above the recent swing high at 5.348, the 78.6% Fibonacci level.\n\nTake Profit Targets:\n- Target 1 (1:1 Risk-Reward): 5.129 (50% Fibonacci level)\n- Target 2 (1:1.5 Risk-Reward): 5.083 (38.2% Fibonacci level)\n- Target 3 (1:2 Risk-Reward): 5.045 (recent low)\n\nRisk Management:\n- Position size should be based on the trader's risk tolerance, with a recommended risk-to-reward ratio of 1:1.5 or better.\n- The ATR of 0.028 on the daily chart can be used to calculate the appropriate stop loss level.\n\nKey Levels to Watch:\n- Resistance: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 5.077\n- Support: Recent swing low at 5.045\n\nPotential Catalysts:\n- Any significant economic or monetary policy updates that could impact the Treasury bill market and the ^IRX index.\n\n## Timeframe Alignment Summary\n\nThe 1-day and 1-week charts for ^IRX are well-aligned, both exhibiting a consistent bearish trend with lower highs and lower lows.
