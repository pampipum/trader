Directional Bias\n\nThe setup quality (6/10) does not meet the threshold for a high-quality setup (7 or higher). However, based on the analysis, there is a bearish bias on the higher timeframes (1d and 1wk), which carries more weight than the short-term bullish signals on the 90m chart.\n\n## 10. Trade Idea\n\nGiven that the setup quality does not meet the threshold for a high-quality setup, a detailed trade idea will not be provided. However, traders should be cautious of potential short-term bullish moves against the larger bearish trend.\n\n## 11. Timeframe Alignment Summary\n\n- 90m timeframe shows short-term bullish signals\n- 1d and 1wk timeframes align in showing bearish pressure\n- The conflict between short-term and longer-term timeframes suggests potential choppy price action or a short-term pullback within a larger downtrend\n\n## 12. Conclusion\n\n- ETH-USD is currently in a long-term downtrend as evidenced by the daily and weekly charts\n- Short-term bullish signals on the 90-minute chart suggest a potential pullback or consolidation\n- The moderate setup quality (6/10) indicates caution is warranted\n- Traders should watch for a potential short opportunity if price reaches the resistance zone around $2670-$3110\n- Key support to watch is the $2457-$2564 zone, which if broken could accelerate the downtrend\n\n## 13.

However, based on the available information:\n\na) Pattern Identification:\n   - Bearish trend on higher timeframes\n   - Short-term bullish signals on lower timeframe\n   - Price near 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level\n\nb) Historical Data Search:\n   - Limited to the provided date range (about 1 year)\n\nc) Outcome Analysis:\n   - Similar setups in the past year likely resulted in continued downtrend with short-term pullbacks\n\nd) Statistical Summary:\n   - Insufficient data for robust statistical analysis\n\ne) Current Setup Comparison:\n   - Current setup aligns with the overall bearish trend seen in the past year\n\nf) Forecast:\n   - Most likely direction: Downward with potential short-term bullish moves\n   - Estimated magnitude: 5-10% downside potential\n   - Estimated duration: 2-4 weeks for significant move\n   - Confidence level: Moderate, due to limited historical data\n\ng) Risk Factors:\n   - Potential for short-term bullish moves could invalidate immediate bearish setups\n   - Macroeconomic factors and overall crypto market sentiment could significantly impact ETH's price action\n\nThis historical pattern analysis should be considered with caution due to the limited data provided. A more comprehensive analysis would require data from multiple market cycles.", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T11:43:07.058173", "available_timeframes": ["90m", "1d", "1wk"]}
