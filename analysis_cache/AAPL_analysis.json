The consolidation phase of the pattern is well-defined, and the breakout above the flag's upper trendline suggests a high likelihood of the trend continuing higher.\n\n#### Support and Resistance\nThe current price is trading above the 20-period and 50-period moving averages on the daily chart, which are acting as dynamic support. Additionally, the 38.2% and 50.0% Fibonacci retracement levels have provided solid support during the recent pullback, further reinforcing the bullish market structure.\n\n#### Momentum\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) is currently positive and has formed a bullish saucer pattern on the daily chart, indicating strengthening upward momentum. The WaveTrend (WT) oscillator is also in a bullish configuration, with the WT1 line above the WT2 line and both lines above the zero line.\n\n### Indicator Analysis\n\n#### RSI\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is currently at 60.67, indicating a healthy balance between buying and selling pressure.
