However, the recent bearish signals on the daily chart and the potential bearish crossover on the weekly chart suggest a potential short-term pullback or consolidation.\n- The weekly chart is also bullish, but the bearish crossover in the Wave Trend indicator and the relatively high volatility (as indicated by the ATR) could lead to increased market uncertainty in the near term.\n\n### Trade Idea\nBased on the overall analysis, a potential long trade setup may present itself if the price pulls back and finds support at the $57,369 (38.2% Fibonacci) or $59,776 (50% Fibonacci) levels on the 90-minute and daily charts. This would align with the broader bullish trend while also providing a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\nSpecific trade details:\n- Entry: $57,369 or $59,776 (depending on market conditions)\n- Stop Loss: $55,100 (61.8% Fibonacci)\n- Take Profit Targets:\n  - 1st Target: $62,182 (61.8% Fibonacci)\n  - 2nd Target: $65,608 (78.6% Fibonacci)\n- Risk-Reward Ratio: Approximately 1:1.5 to 1:2\n\nHowever, it's important to monitor the market closely and be prepared to adjust the trade plan if the broader market structure or technical indicators change significantly. The potential bearish signals on the weekly chart suggest a need for cautious optimism and proper risk management.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe multi-timeframe analysis of the BTC-USD trading instrument reveals a bullish overall trend, with the 90-minute and daily charts in alignment.
