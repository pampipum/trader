Directional Bias\nBased on the Setup Quality Assessment score of 5.5/10, we do not have a high-quality setup (score 7 or higher) for either a LONG or SHORT trade. The current market conditions show conflicting signals across different timeframes, suggesting a cautious approach.\n\n### 9. Timeframe Alignment Summary\n- Short-term (90m and Daily) timeframes show bearish momentum\n- Long-term (Weekly) timeframe indicates bullish sentiment\n- This misalignment suggests a potential transition period or consolidation\n\n### 10. Conclusion\nThe analysis reveals a moderate setup with conflicting signals across timeframes. While the short-term trend is bearish, the long-term trend remains bullish. The price is currently in a potential oversold condition on shorter timeframes, but there's no clear high-probability trade setup at this moment.\n\nKey points:\n1. Short-term bearish momentum vs. long-term bullish trend\n2. Potential oversold conditions on 90m and Daily charts\n3. Increasing OBV across all timeframes suggests underlying buying pressure\n4. Price near key Fibonacci levels, which may act as support/resistance\n\nTraders should exercise caution and wait for clearer signals or a higher-quality setup before entering any positions. Consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. Potential bullish reversal: Watch for bullish reversal signals on 90m and Daily charts, confirmed by a break above the fast MA and positive shifts in WaveTrend and AO.\n2. Continued bearish momentum: A break below the lower Bollinger Band on the Daily chart could signal further downside, but be cautious of oversold conditions.\n\nRisk management is crucial given the current market conditions. Consider smaller position sizes and wider stop losses if trading in this environment. Always align trades with your personal risk tolerance and overall trading strategy.\n\n### 11.
