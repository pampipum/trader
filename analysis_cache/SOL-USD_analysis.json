across the 90-minute and weekly timeframes, but not the daily chart.\n\nb) Momentum and Volatility (15/20 points):\n   - The RSI is in the overbought territory on the 90-minute chart, neutral on the daily and weekly charts.\n   - The price is near the Bollinger Band edges on the 90-minute chart, but Bollinger Band data is not available for the other timeframes.\n\nc) WaveTrend Oscillator Analysis

setup quality is moderate, with some conflicting signals across the different timeframes. The bullish trend and momentum on the 90-minute and weekly charts are encouraging, but the neutral conditions on the daily chart and the lack of AO data introduce some uncertainty.\n\n## Directional Bias\nBased on the moderate setup quality assessment, the directional bias is NEUTRAL. While the longer-term trend on the weekly chart remains bullish, the consolidation on the daily chart and the overbought conditions on the 90-minute chart suggest a lack of clear short-term directionality.\n\n## Detailed Trade Idea\nGiven the moderate setup quality and the neutral directional bias, no detailed trade idea is provided. The current market conditions warrant a cautious approach and further monitoring of the price action and indicator signals before considering a potential trading opportunity.\n\n## Timeframe Alignment Summary\nThe different timeframes show a mixed picture:\n- The 90-minute and weekly charts display a clear bullish trend, with the price above the moving averages and the WaveTrend lines in a bullish state.\n- The daily chart, however, shows a consolidation phase, with the WaveTrend lines in a bearish state and the RSI in a neutral condition.\n- The lack of AO data on all timeframes and the absence of Bollinger Bands and OBV data limit the ability to fully assess the short-term momentum and volume characteristics.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Solana (SOL-USD) setup displays a moderate overall quality, with a mix of bullish and neutral signals across the different timeframes. The strong uptrend on the weekly chart is encouraging, but the consolidation on the daily chart and the overbought conditions on the 90-minute chart suggest a need for caution. Without a clear directional bias and some missing indicator data, no detailed trade idea is provided at this time. Continued monitoring of the price action and indicator signals is recommended to identify a more reliable trading opportunity in the future.\n\n## Historical Pattern Analysis\nDue to the lack of historical data provided, a comprehensive historical pattern analysis cannot be performed.
